Introduction to Kubernetes (K8S)
=> Kubernetes is an open-source platform that manages Docker containers in the form of a cluster. Along with the automated deployment and scaling of containers, it provides healing by automatically restarting failed containers and rescheduling them when their hosts die. This capability improves the application’s availability

~Kubernetes was originally created by Google. 
~Kubernetes was officially launched on June 7,2014.
That time they announce it was open-sourced  by google.
~The first stable version, kubernetes 1.0 ,was relesed on July 21,2015.

What is Kubernetes (k8s)?
=> Kubernetes is an orchestration tool/container management tool , via which container can be managed , horinzantal auto scaled , route based path pathing ,loadbalancing , deployment doman base pathing, and many other container relates automation & orchestration can be performed by k8s
OR
Kubernetes is an open-source Container Management tool that automates container deployment, container scaling, descaling, and container load balancing (also called a container orchestration tool). It is written in Golang and has a vast community because it was first developed by Google and later donated to CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation). Kubernetes can group ‘n’ number of containers into one logical unit for managing and deploying them easily. It works brilliantly with all cloud vendors i.e. public, hybrid, and on-premises. 

Why use kubernetes ?
=> kubernetes is used for autoscaling , bin packing , cost management , microservice deployment , roll back, rolling out new deployment , self healing , load balancing , hpa , secrets management , automation in deployment , microservice deployment its the ideal tool combination for microservice deployment 

What are kubernetes objects ?
=> Objects the resources of your kubernets orchestration tool 
Types of object are : 
1. pods
2. services - nord port , cluster 
3. namespace 
4. replica set 
5. replica controller 
6. daemon set 
7. horizantal pod autoscaling
8. statefull set
9. ingress & ingress controller
10. deployment
11. presistent volume & presistent volume controller 
12. config map & config secrets 
    Rbac
    Helm chart 

What are Cluster ?
=> Cluster is a infra or imaginary infra term in which you have minimum two nodes , one is master node/control plan & another is worker node/slave nord 
~Master node/control plane : The kubernetes control plan manages clusters and resources such as worker node pods.
The control plane recive information such as cluster activity enternal & external request and more 
~Worker node/slave nord : In the kubernates a worker node's is a machine that manage user defined container and process data in cluster 

What is the pods ?
=> A pod in kubernetes is a group of one or more container that are the smallest unit of deployment and execation in kubernates application Pod share storage, networking and other resource.
Type of pods 
1.Intra pod 
2.Inter pod 

What is manifest files ?
=> In kubernetes manifest files are nothing but configuration files are in kubernetes that defines the desire state of resources. Manifest files written in jason and YAML formate 

What is minikube ?
=> Minikube is light weight kubernate implementation that creates a vm on local machine and deploys a sample cluster containing only node .

What is services ?
=>Its a k8s object , its important job is to expose your pod / microservice webapp deployed in pods outside the cluster , or keep it secure with in the cluster or provide a singular static endpoint or provide loadbalancing feature these are features of service
- SERVICE HAVE THREE TYPES :
1. Cluster IP : static IP gives 
2. Nodeport : gives port 30,000 32,767
3. Loadbalancing 
-In Kubernetes, a Service is a method for exposing a network application that is running as one or more Pods in your cluster.

What is Cluster IP ?
=> It provide static IP and static endpoint to your pods , you cannot expose your microservice for the people of internet it is only accessible withing the cluster 

What is Nodeport?
=> Port range 30,000 and 32,767 nodeport is used to expose your container webapp microservice pod's port to the node's port

What is Loadbalancer?
=> Is to provide a a singular endpoint to your nodeport , equally distribute traffic to your nodeport , be a singular endpoint which can be mapped with dns or domain
