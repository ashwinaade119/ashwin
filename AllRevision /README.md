**LINUX** stands for <sub>Lovable Intellect Not Using XP</sub>
# LINUX
Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, the Linux operating system is a powerful and flexible open-source software platform. It acts as the basis for a variety of devices, such embedded systems, cell phones, servers, and personal computers. Linux, that’s well-known for its reliability, safety, and flexibility, allows users to customize and improve their environment to suit specific needs. With an extensive and active community supporting it, Linux is an appealing choice for people as well as companies due to its wealth of resources and constant developments.

## Why use Linux?
Because it is free, open-source, and extremely flexible, Linux is widely utilized. For servers and developers, it is the ideal option because it offers strong security, stability, and performance. Generally interoperable hardware, a broad software library, and a vibrant community that offers support and regular updates are the many benefits of Linux. Due to its adaptability, users can customize the operating system according to their own needs, whether they become for personal or large enterprise use.

## Architecture of Linux

## Kernel 
Kernel is the core of the Linux based operating system. It virtualizes the common hardware resources of the computer to provide each process with its virtual resources. This makes the process seem as if it is the sole process running on the machine. The kernel is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes. Different types of the kernel are: 

***Monolithic Kernel***

***Hybrid kernels***

***Exo kernels***

***Micro kernels***

## Advantages of Linux
The main advantage of Linux is it is an open-source operating system. This means the source code is easily available for everyone and you are allowed to contribute, modify and distribute the code to anyone without any permissions.

In terms of security, Linux is more secure than any other operating system. It does not mean that Linux is 100 percent secure, it has some malware for it but is less vulnerable than any other operating system. So, it does not require any anti-virus software.

The software updates in Linux are easy and frequent.

Various Linux distributions are available so that you can use them according to your requirements or according to your taste.

Linux is freely available to use on the internet.

It has large community support.

It provides high stability. It rarely slows down or freezes and there is no need to reboot it after a short time.

It maintains the privacy of the user.

The performance of the Linux system is much higher than other operating systems. It allows a large number of people to work at the same time and it handles them efficiently.

It is network friendly.

The flexibility of Linux is high. There is no need to install a complete Linux suite; you are allowed to install only the required components.

Linux is compatible with a large number of file formats.

It is fast and easy to install from the web. It can also install it on any hardware even on your old computer system.

It performs all tasks properly even if it has limited space on the hard disk.

## Disadvantages of Linux
It is not very user-friendly. So, it may be confusing for beginners.

It has small peripheral hardware drivers as compared to windows.

## Linux Commands
Basic tools for utilizing the command line interface (CLI) to communicate with the operating system are Linux commands. Commonly used commands include ls to list contents of directories, cd to modify directories, and pwd to show the path of the current directory. With commands like cp (copy), mv (move), and rm (delete), someone can manage file activities. Commands for system information and management include free for memory use, df to evaluate disk space usage, and top for monitoring system processes. Utilizing networking commands such netstat, ifconfig, and ping, users can monitor and troubleshoot network connections. Package management differs depending on the distribution; Fedora-based machines use dnf, while Debian-based systems use apt. Commands like cat, grep, awk, and sed are required for editing text files. Knowing and performing these directions well enables. For clear understanding about the Linux commands refer this link.

## What is Linux Operating System?
Linux is an open-source operating system developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It provides a customizable and secure alternative to proprietary systems. With its stable performance, Linux is widely used across devices, from personal computers to servers and smartphones. The collaborative efforts of its developer community continue to drive innovation, making Linux a dominant force in the world of computing.
